- 👋 Hi, I’m @BRNiu
- 👀 I’m interested in figuring out the exqiusite and delicate components of genomes by bioinformatic analysis to improve the production and quality of main crops such as wheat.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning in University of Chinese Academey Sciences(UCAS) and working in Lulab in Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology(IGDB), China Academy of Sciences(CAS). FeiLu@Fei-Lu, as my supervisor, has conducted my undergraduate thesis "The Evolution of Transposons in Triticeae". Welcome to explore our Lab in https://plantgeneticslab.github.io/home/.
- 💞️ I’m looking to conmunicate and collaborate on genetics, genomic, statiatics, programming(JAVA/Python/R), evolutional and developmental biology, as well as wheat cultivation.
- 📫 How to reach me: nbeirui@gmail.com. Welcome to contact with me!
